Exploring the World of SQL with Coursera ðŸš€
In the year 2023, I embarked on a remarkable journey to dive deep into the realm of SQL and database querying. This project, "Querying Databases Using SQL SELECT Statement," was an exciting online endeavor offered by Coursera Project Network.

Under the guidance of Arimoro Olayinka Imisioluwa, a fantastic Guided Project Instructor at Coursera Inc., I ventured into the world of SQL, eager to unlock its secrets.

What Made This Project Special:
Skill Building: Throughout this journey, I dedicated my efforts to mastering SQL database queryingâ€”a foundational skill for anyone navigating the data landscape.

Hands-On Learning: The project was more than theory; it was about practical application. I had the chance to put my SQL SELECT statements into action, gaining valuable hands-on experience.

Coursera Certification: Coursera, the reputable online learning platform, has officially confirmed my identity and validated my active involvement in this project, ensuring its authenticity.
